## Information
First attempt at using React Leaflet to display the parkway closures. Many thanks to /u/Kenilwort from the /r/Asheville subreddit for creating the original kml map. I wouldn't have been able to generate this without him mapping out the coordinates on the parkway.

output.geojson is generated by taking the output.kml from [my other repo](https://github.com/jeffbliss/blue_ridge_parkway_closures) and converting it with [mapbox to geojson CLI tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mapbox/togeojson): `togeojson output.kml > output.geojson`
